# Face-Grouping-AI
Zain Sharief - OCR A-Level Computer Science NEA 

The code is split up into different sections:

- The face detection and face recognition folders contains all the code used in their respective iterations. This code is NOT required to be present to test the entire program.
- The main.py, SQLfiles.py, interface.py and model.py files ARE required to test the final program.

When testing the final program, and the face detection/recognition model, the respective unzipped weight folders (main program requires both) are required in the same folder as the code. These can be found at this link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Vaaa0w_I93l_cMByeypZJQGFItr9vsI9?usp=sharing

The entire program can be tested by running the main.py file.

The citations for the dataset can be found below as follows.
